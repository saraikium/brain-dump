# Getting Started:

Welcome to my knowledge garden. I'm pretty new to this and most of the notes you'll find will probably be empty. But I intend to add more content and improve the existing content as the time goes on. 

## How navigate this site?

You can start anywhere, there's no specific hierarchy.  Just click on a topic you find interesting or search for something. For now I only intend add the computer science and programming content but in the future I may add more. 

## Status of a note
A note can be in one of four stages of *CODE*. *CODE* stands for Capture, Organize, Distill and Express. 

 - **Capture**: means I'm still in the process of capturing information about a topic I find interesting. The contents of the note may be disorganized and unrefined. 

- **Organize**:  I've started organizing the the note to make it more useful. The information contained in more organized. The overall structure of the topic has started to take a proper shape in this stage. 

- **Distill** :  This stage means that I've started working on capturing the essence of a topic, organizing and polishing the information presented.

- **Express**: It means that the note is ready to be shared with the others. It doesn't mean I'll stop adding new information to the topic, it just means that it's refined enough to be used as a learning material.
